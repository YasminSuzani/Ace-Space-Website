    <p>Every asexual has different experiences related to their sexuality. Some find out their sexuality in different ways; some receive different responses to coming out. I asked my fellow asexuals a few questions about their experiences. Here are just a few of their answers:</p>
    <h3>How did you find out you were asexual?</h3>
    <!--<div class="quote">
    <h4>"</h4>
    <p>I think I always knew that I didn't feel attraction the same way the others did around me, they would make jokes about passing strangers and how hot they were or talk about partnerships that they had that lasted only weeks and I knew that I could never just have a "fling".  It was always awkward when they asked me "Isn't he hot" and I'd just shrug. [After a while, they stopped engagine me in "the game" of "Isn't he hot", and they started asking "What's wrong with you? Why can't you just be normal?"] I didn't know what the asexuality spectrum was until I joined the GSA at my school and had made some lifelong gay friends. Being educated really helped me because it was like a lightbulb turned on and I was like OH I am normal!</p>

    <p class="fancyfont">"I first heard about asexuality in my late 20s and probably didn't identify that way til I was older than 30.  My college had a gay straight alliance but I can't remember asexuality ever being mentioned. I heard about it on the internet and it took awhile to come to identify myself that way. I don't know if I had internalized aphobia so much as a lack of education, and just thought that I couldn't be asexual because it must be more complicated than I had heard. Like there must have been something special about it and there was no way I could be that way. It took a long time to realize that I wasn't going to enjoy dating/ relationships, and that that was both okay and an identity I had." -Sarah, 35, Asexual</p>

    <h3>What challenges have you had to face because of your asexuality?</h3>
    <button id="button2">Show</button>
    <div id="q2div">
    <p class="fancyfont">"There's people out there who you will fall in love with, people who don't understand your asexuality. In my last relationship, I was afraid of hanging out with someone in private because I knew what'll happen and I didn't have the courage to refuse them." -Anonymous, 18, Asexual
    <p class="fancyfont">"I spent a large chunk of my life thinking there was just something wrong with me. I always felt like an alien when, for example, my college friends would talk about how they hadn't had sex in weeks and were desperate to get laid -- I have never felt like that in my life. And some of my friends definitely noticed that I never showed any interest in flirting with people at parties, or hooking up, or anything like that. I think the sexualization of society is a BIG part of that, and I also thing that, when I was in college in the early '90s, asexuality just wasn't talked about much, and when it was, it was treated like a problem that you needed treatment for. Things are better now, but there's still some ace erasure/acephobia out there. For example, a friend of my husband's writes a dating/relationships advice column, which frequently includes things about how, if you have a 'dead bedroom' (God, I hate that phrase) and don't have frequent sex, your relationship is doomed, or that sexual attraction is one of the most important aspects of a relationship. And he's certainly not the only one who gives advice like that! Not having a lot of sex within a relationship is treated as a death knell in a relationship, and I think that's really unhealthy, for ace people AND allo people! There are a LOT of reasons why sex in a relationship might not happen, and there are much more important things to focus on -- for me, emotional closeness and understanding is SO much more important than sex and sexual attraction. An emotional and intellectual connection is a vital part of a relationship for me. And I think those connections are longer-lasting, and a stronger foundation to build a lifelong relationship on." -Anonymous, 50, Grey-Ace</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"I feel like I've always felt societal pressure to be in a relationship. Asexuality wasn't something widely known about, and when I was growing up people just assumed that everyone would date and marry. My community was also especially narrow-minded regarding women's roles in the family, and in school it was always mentioned that girls would be mothers. Socially there was always talk about dating/ crushes that was hard to participate in, even as far back as elementary school. Those pressures eased in a little in college and even more when I moved into my own place as an adult." -Sarah, 35, Asexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"I've had a few encounters, the weirdest being my brother saying "you're not a plant" when i came out to him as asexual. I also had an issue with a previous boyfriend who didn't quite understand and kinda treated me like i was broken for it." -Jun, 16, Biromantic Asexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"Yeah I've had to deal with my family calling me a freak for never participating in their stupid games of "which random person here is hot" and I've had to experience very awkward times with my sisters when they just want to talk about sex and things like that when I'm really not comfortable around it, and I've felt like anytime I do express interest in anything sexual, because asexuality is also a spectrum, I have to hide or others won't take me seriously." -Valentine, 17, Bi-demiromantic Demisexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"Sometimes, I still think I'm broken, and I can't be 'fixed,' especially since I know it's expected that I'll want sex eventually, and I don't think that'll ever happen. I'm afraid to enter romantic relationships, because it's so ingrained into society that romantic relationships (even in high school) should start to have sexual elements in them eventually. I couldn't stand to fall in love with someone and then disappoint them because of my asexuality." -Yasmin, 17, Asexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"I think that aromantics and asexuals in general tend to be erased even in the LGBTQ+ community and especially in the media. Usually, people don't understand what being asexual means so I just let them assume I'm straight because it's easier to let them think that than to have to explain myself. Also,  sex is considered to be a necessary human function so it's hard for allosexuals especially to understand that lack of need." -Maddy, 18, Asexual</p>

    <h3>Has your gender in any way affected how you're treated in society as an asexual?</h3>
    <button id="button3">Show</button>
    <div id="q3div">
    <p class="fancyfont">"The issue of gender mostly affected me as an asexual because of the societal and peer pressure on afab individuals in my community. I remember being encouraged to show gendered behavior as far back as I can remember, not by my family, but at school and by friends. Some specific instances go from when I was 4 years old to when I was in high school. In AP History our teacher actually taught that women were naturally better caretakers than men, and that if the afabs in class did not stay home to care for our future children or chose to feed our babies formula, they would grow up sickly and not do well in school. This was in an AP class! I was always challenging these ideas which branded me as "weird". Luckily I think being weird is what let me broaden my horizons and choose to live a life where I could freely be myself. It took some time and distance to get away from the ideas I was raised with to accept that I was asexual." -Sarah, 35, Asexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"I guess since guys (I'm trans masculine btw) are more expected to be sexual by nature, it's been a bit hard to make lasting friendships with other boys since a lot of the ones I've know talked about sex way too much for me." -Jun, 16, Biromantic Asexual</p>
