    <p>Because sex is expected in a lot of relationships, sometimes the future seems bleak to asexuals. It doesn't have to be that way. Asexuals can have fulfilling relationships, whether that be having lasting friendships or having romantic relationships. Here are a few stories of asexuals who feel fulfilled in their relationships:</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"Personally I used to date a lot and realized romantic style attachments were not for me. I would be happy with the idea that someone liked spending time with me, but really uncomfortable and stressed after dates. Eventually I realized that I just didn't want to be in a romantic commitment with anyone and stopped dating. I think I am also aromantic and don't like romantic gestures, and in a romantic relationship I always feel like I don't know exactly what a partner would want or expect from me. The most longest dating-type relationship I ever had was long distance, which I think contributed to its longevity, but I just don't want to spend everyday with a person in a romantic/ sexual way." -Sarah, 35, asexual</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"I'm a happily married ace, married to an allo. Like I mentioned above, I didn't realize I was ace until we had been married for a few years. I think our relationship is really good, and really healthy. I do worry about him being happy and satisfied in the relationship, but we make communication a big priority. We talk a lot, and check in with each other, making sure that we're both happy. He knows that, if he is unhappy, he can talk to me, and vice versa. We love each other deeply, and have that strong emotionally connection that makes our relationship work. We both respect each other, and genuinely like each other, so it works well. 
    
    I have been in romantic relationships that were much less comfortable. When I was younger, in my 20s, I felt like I had to... perform, for lack of a better word, sexually, in order to be a good girlfriend. Like, I didn't feel like I could turn my boyfriend down when he wanted to have sex, and I felt like I had to respond in certain ways so that he never suspected that I wasn't into it. It wasn't that I didn't care about him, or find him attractive -- I did! I just didn't have nearly as much interest in having sex as he did. I was also in an abusive marriage, briefly, and that was very uncomfortable. Saying no to sex was not something I was ever able to do with that ex. The pressure to perform, and to never even hint that I wasn't 1000% into it was VERY strong, and very damaging. I'm really relieved to not be in that situation anymore, and count myself very lucky to have married someone who is as accepting and loving as my husband is." -Anonymous, 50, Grey-Ace</p>
    <p class="fancyfont">"In the past, I've felt pressured to act a certain way because I felt that I had to as a 'proper' girlfriend, like it was expected of me to do and feel certain things. It wasn't until I left that relationship that I realized that there should be no expectations and that there's no right way to be in a relationship. My current relationship is definitely the most comfortable I've ever been and I'm really thankful to my boyfriend for always being there for me and for respecting my boundaries, which wouldn't happen in my past relationships. [My current boyfriend is] super chill about me being asexual. He's also a really open person and that's just made me so much more comfortable with sharing stuff with him because I know he won't judge me. I'm really glad I met him." -Maddy, 18, Asexual</p>
